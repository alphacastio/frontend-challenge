# Alphacast Frontend Challenge

You must create a web page with Next.JS, React and Typescript to consume the PokeAPI, and build a List/Detail view.

In the list view, you may accomplish the following statements:

- Order by name, or order number, ascending or descending ( order number ascending by default)
- Filter pokemon by types and generations
- Search pokemon by name, the user will be able to use '?' to represent a missing character in the name, and '*' to represent a missing part of the name.
- List the name, photo, generation, types, and order number of them

In the detail view, you may accomplish the following statements:

- Detail the number, name, photo, types, generation
- Make a spider chart with the ability points of the pokemon with d3.js library

You may have to create a GitHub repository and record the process of building the challenge there. (if you make a private repository please add @emacosti06 and @masaez to review it)
If you're not familiar with GraphQL, we leave here the query that you have to make to get the needed data.

We strongly recommend using TailwindCSS for styles (Spoiler, we use that)

Feel free to ask questions if you needed.
